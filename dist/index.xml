      <title>The CI/CD Pipeline</title>

      <description>The CI/CD pipeline is a software development approach that emphasizes frequent code integration, testing, and deployment. CI stands for Continuous Integration, which means that code changes are regularly merged into a shared repository and tested to ensure that they don&amp;rsquo;t break the existing code. CD, or Continuous Delivery/Deployment, focuses on automating the process of packaging, testing, and deploying code changes into production environments. By implementing a CI/CD pipeline, developers can catch issues early in the development cycle, reduce manual testing time, and accelerate the delivery of new features to end-users.</description>
